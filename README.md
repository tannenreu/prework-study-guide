# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I wanted to learn more about coding and the best way to do that is by practicing. I created a Prework Study Guide using git and gitHub, VS Code, and the command line. I created this to prepare myself better for this class as I have no CP experience. I became more familiar with programming and learned that this process can be frustrating but satisfying when you accomplish your end goal.
